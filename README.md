# Analysis of TCGA-MESO Samples Based on Mutation Variants and Gene Expression
BMI 713 final project of Katrina Liu

All produced images are in `images/` folder. The project code R file is named `Project.Rmd` and the knitted html is named `Project.html`. The backup TCGA data is uploaded as well as `tcga-data.rdata` in case the query download is not successful. The final writeup is named `BMI713_Project_Writeup.pdf".


## Abstract
The TCGA dataset is comprised of a variety of patient
sample information collected by many project. The project
TCGA-MSEO in particular focused on mesothelioma, a
type of cancer which mostly arises in the mesothelial surfaces
of tissues in the pleura. In this project, sample information,
gene expression level, and mutation variants
information associated with the disease are collected by
the TCGA-MESO project, providing the foundation of this
study. We conducted principle component analysis and
clustering to see if there are correlation between the gene
expression data and mutational variants on the general
level.
